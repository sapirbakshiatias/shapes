- Calculates properties like area and perimeter.
- Save and load shapes to/from a file.

## Project Structure
The main directory structure:
- `src/ex2/` - Contains the core Java files for the project.
- `src/ex2/geo/` - Handles the geometry and shape calculations.
- `src/ex2/gui/` - Implements the graphical user interface (GUI) for the project.
- `src/ex2/ex2/` - Contains auxiliary classes and utilities.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **GUI Framework:** Swing
